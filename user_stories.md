### User Story: Delete Doctor's Profile

**Title:** Delete Doctor's Profile

**As an admin**, I want to **delete a doctor's profile from the portal**, so that **outdated or incorrect doctor information can be removed.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The admin can select an existing doctor's profile for deletion.
2. The system prompts for confirmation before permanently deleting a doctor's profile.
